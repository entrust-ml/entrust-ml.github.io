Whether we like it or not, deepfakes are now part of our daily digital lives. What used
to require tons of compute and very advanced skills has now become a commodity
that any programmer can leverage with a laptop and an off-the-shelf GPU.

The last remaining barrier was data. The presumption was that even the best model
needed specific data to generate data useful for an identity theft (a face biometrics or
a government ID).

This assumption is unfortunately defeated by empirical evidence: with the right
amount of prompting, both open-source and proprietary models are now able to
generate highly realistic identity samples. 

Below are two examples. These government
IDs never existed and would arguably fool a human analyst. Is the identity industry
doomed?

We have good news for you: the answer is an overwhelming no. At Onfido, we saw this
threat coming years ago and acted decisively against it, for the benefit of our
customers.

We could do it because we are equipped with a unique combination of
machine learning expertise and an in-house Fraud Lab, both totally 15 years of
industrial experience in the fight against fraud.

^: Here is the first deepfake we saw in production. We call this one "deepfake patient 0".
We spotted it in 2021 and built our flagship Motion product anticipating such deepfakes
at scale in production. The future proved us right.

Let us explain why these deepfakes are far from being as dangerous as they are (at
least if you use us as an identity provider) and how we stay ahead of the curve.

**Early detection is key**: Fraudsters use a trial-and-error approach. They first try a new
approach at a small scale before going gung ho with it. Our continuous monitoring of
production gives us the ability to catch these frauds early on. 

One would be tempted
to think that this is a needle-in-the-haystack problem, which turns out to be true.
However, we have built machine-learning based, proprietary methods to detect these
deepfakes in the massive amount of genuine data.

**Deepfakes are out-of-distribution for machine learning models**: As realistic as the
GenAI-generated samples may be, they do not present the visual defects due to the
physical process of capture through a cell phone camera. In other words: they look
too perfect. 

Our models are trained on large amounts of real data and therefore
consider these samples to be out-of-distribution. To fool our models, fraudsters
would need to not only generate highly-realistic samples, but also simulate the
physical process of capture.

^: Machine learning model project samples into an "embedding" space. Samples that
have not been captured by an actual device land far away from the genuine space,
making them suspicious to the model.

**Deepfakes leave traces behind them that are invisible to the human eye but visible to
the machine**. Those can be very small artefacts at the pixel level as well as unusual
noise patterns in the image. A well-maintained supervised learning engine trained on
millions of samples spots these trails and catches the majority of deepfakes. 

This
approach is heavy, though: it requires a lot of data, constant retraining and
continuous generation of new fraud samples. It also goes against valid privacy
concerns. We will therefore keep doing this for the foreseeable future but are also
working on the long game – secret sauce in the making!

**Deepfakes require an injection attack**: Fraudsters who generate deepfakes need to
"inject" these samples into the device used for identity verification (usually, a
smartphone). This requires the fraudster to bypass security features of cell phones,
which become harder and harder as manufacturers raise the bar. We provide an
additional layer of protection using a proprietary, in-house device intelligence that we
improve continuously. 

Alternatively, fraudsters may attempt to use a genuine phone to
capture a photo or video of the deepfake. We call this a "video-of-video" and have
developed specific machine learning models against them. Much like deepfakes,
screen captures leave small trails behind them that our models catch robustly.

**Fraudsters cannot hill-climb with deepfakes**: Hill-climbing is a technique used by
fraudsters to continuously improve their attack based on rejections from the system.
Hill climbing is useful when fraudsters can build a mental model of what is wrong
with their failed attempt. 

Counter-intuitively, generating highly realistic deepfakes
makes hill-climbing very hard. If a highly realistic deepfake was rejected, then what
goes? We observe the consequence in production: fraudsters need to perform a large
number of repeat attempts with many variants of their models. This is where our
Repeat Attempt product kicks in.

**Design Secret sauce**: We design our Identity products from the ground up and entirely
in-house. This opens the door to a significant amount of secret sauce, building the
UI/UX, the SDK-based capture process and the machine learning models together in
one go. 

This approach allows us to reach an unmatched combination of low friction
and fraud protection. These designs represent a significant value proposition for our
customers.

In conclusion, while deepfakes make the headlines in the press and represent
significant work for us, we provide strong protection against them thanks to:
- Early detection and continuous monitoring
- Dedicated machine learning models
- SDK-level injection attack protection
- Proprietary and constantly evolving product designs

## Predictions

Fraud is becoming a scaled, organized business. Just do the math: if a bitcoin
company offers a &#0036;50 voucher for an account opening, opening 1,000 fake accounts
brings you &#0036;50K in a few hours. Not a bad day.

Targeted account takeovers are also becoming attractive. Careless people still use
weak passwords. More careful people use a proper 2FA. The majority of people won't
go through the hassle of using hardware-based security (think yubikey). This leaves
the door wide open for well-prepared software-based attacks.
Deepfakes on government IDs and biometrics will become even more prevalent. As
deepfake generation has become a commodity, other fraud vectors are just harder to
produce at scale. Our multi-layered, constantly evolving protection will continue to
protect our customers and their end users.

Asymptotically, the fight is moving on-device. Deepfakes require an injection attack.
Ensuring that the user is using a genuine device will be key. Entrust's extensive
knowledge of device security comes as a strong complement to Onfido's
machine-learning based technology.

Data moats remain more useful than ever. As we reach a very high level of
performance, just measuring performance numbers requires very large volumes of
data. In addition, fraudsters' early attempts are often un-noticeable at small scale.
The data moat we have built over the past decade gives us a unique edge against
deepfakes.

In short, while deepfakes can be worrying from the public standpoint, the landscape
in industry is very different: we provide strong protection against them. We work hard
for our customers so they don't have to.
